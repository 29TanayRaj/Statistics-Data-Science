# t-test 

The Student's t-test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, accounting for the sample size and variability of the data.

There are three major varitions of t-test:

i. One-sample t-test

ii. Independent two sample t-test

iii. Paired t-test

## One sample t-test

#### When to use?
- For comparing the sample mean to a poulation mean that is known or is hypothesied.

#### Idea behind it?
- The basic idea behind the on sample t-test is to standardize the difference between sample and population mean by considering the standard deviation in the data and the sample size.


#### Formula 

$$ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{o}}{s/\sqrt(n)}$$

Where 
- $\bar{x}$ is mean.
- $\mu_{o}$ is the expeected mean (population) or hypothesised mean.
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation.
- n is the sample size.

Note: This statistic has n-1 degress of freedom (used to calculate the critical value).


#### Hypotheis taken 
 Null hypothesis 
- The sample mean and hypotheised mean are the same 
$$H_{0} : \bar{x} = \mu$$

 Alternate hypothesis

Two sided 
- The sample mean and hypothesis mean are different
$$H_{1} : \bar{x} \neq \mu$$

One sided
- One is greater than or lower than the other 
$$H_{1} : \bar{x} < \mu$$
$$H_{1} : \bar{x} > \mu$$

#### Assumptions for student's tests:

1. Independence of samples : The samples should be independelty drawn from the sample.
2. Normalility of sample mean: The sample mean should follow a normal distribution 

Note: If the sample size is, $n>30$ the second assumption becomes less critical due to central limit theorem.
