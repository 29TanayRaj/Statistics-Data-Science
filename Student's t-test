## Student's t-test

The Student's t-test is a statistical method used to determine if there's a significant difference between the means of two groups, considering sample size and data variability.

**Three main variations:**

1. **One-sample t-test**
2. **Independent two-sample t-test**
3. **Paired t-test**

### One-sample t-test

**When to use:**
* To compare a sample mean to a known or hypothesized population mean.

**Idea:**
* Standardizes the difference between sample and population means by considering standard deviation and sample size.

**Formula:**
$$ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{o}}{s/\sqrt(n)}$$

where:
* `x̄`: Sample mean
* `μ₀`: Hypothesized population mean
* `s`: Sample standard deviation
* `n`: Sample size

**Degrees of freedom:** `n - 1`

**Hypotheses:**

* **Null hypothesis (H₀):** `x̄ = μ₀` (No difference)
* **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):**
  * **Two-sided:** `x̄ ≠ μ₀` (Difference exists)
  * **One-sided:**
    * `x̄ < μ₀` (Sample mean is less than population mean)
    * `x̄ > μ₀` (Sample mean is greater than population mean)
