    "## Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between sample and population means (or between two sample means) when the population variance is known and the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n>30) It’s based on the normal distribution (Z-distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Population mean and variance is known here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic in a Z-test is the Z-score, which tells you how many standard deviations a data point (sample mean) is from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For comparing a sample mean to population mean \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z={\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{array}{r l}{\\bullet}&{{}\\bar{X}=\\,{\\mathsf{Sample ~ mean}}}\\\\\n",
    " {\\bullet}&{{}\\mu=\\mathrm{poplation~standard~deviatior}}\\\\ {\\bullet}&\n",
    " {{}\\sigma={\\mathsf{p o p u l a t i o n~s t a n d a r d~d e v i a t i o r}}}\\\\\n",
    "  {\\bullet}&{{}n={\\mathsf{s a m p l e~s i z e}}}\\end{array}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For comparing two sample means \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z={\\frac{\\left(\\bar{X_{1}}-\\bar{X_{2}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}}+{\\frac{\\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}}}$$\n",

    "$\\bullet ~~~~ \\bar{X_{1}},\\bar{X_{2}} ~ \\mathsf{are ~ sample ~means ~of ~two ~samples}\\\\$\n",

    "#### Types of Z-tests\n",
    "- One-sample Z-test: Compares the mean of a sample to a known population mean.\n",
    "- Two-sample Z-test: Compares the means of two independent samples.\n",
    "- Proportion Z-test: Compares sample proportions to population proportions or between two sample proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions for Z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sample data should be drawn from a normally distributed population, or the sample size should be large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.\n",
    "- Population variance or standard deviation must be known.\n",
    "- Random sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example \n",
    "Problem: A factory claims that the average lifetime of its light bulbs is 1000 hours. A random sample of 50 bulbs has a mean lifetime of 980 hours and a standard deviation of 40 hours. Is there evidence at the 0.05 significance level to doubt the factory's claim?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Formulation: There is no significant diffence between the sample and population means \n",
    "\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis $H_{o}:  \\mu= 1000 \\mathsf{(no ~difference ~from ~the ~claimed ~lifetime)}$\n",
    "- Alternative hypothesis $H_{1}:  \\mu \\neq 1000 \\mathsf{(there ~is ~some ~difference)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given,\n",
    "- Sample mean $\\bar = 980$\n",
    "- Population mean $\\mu = 1000$\n",
    "- Population standard deviation $\\sigma = 40$\n",
    "- Sample size $n = 50$\n",
    "- Signifiance level $\\alpha = 0.05$\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-test statistic \n",
    "$$Z={\\frac{980-1000}{{\\frac{40}{\\sqrt{50}}}}}={\\frac{-20}{5.657}}=-3.54$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision: Using the standard normal distribution table, the critical Z-value for a two-tailed test at \n",
    "$\\alpha=0.05$ is approximately ±1.96. Since −3.54 is outside this range, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: There is significant evidence to suggest that the factory's claim about the lifetime of its bulbs may be incorrect."
