    "## Z-test for Porportions \n",
    "\n",
    "This is used to test whether a sample poportion p differes from a known or hypothesized population $p_{0}$. This test is particularly useful when dealing with categorical data, such as success/failure and determining whether the observed proportion is significantly different from a given proportion. \n",
    "\n",
    "### One-Sample z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis \n",
    "- Null hypothesis: $H_{o}: ~p = p_{o}$\n",
    "- Alternate hypothesis two tailed: $H_{1}: p \\neq p_{o}$\n",
    "- Alternate hypothesis one tailed: $H_{1}: p>p ~or~ p<p_{o}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions: \n",
    "- The sample should large enough i.e. $np_{o}\\geq5$ and $n(1-p_{o})\\geq5$\n",
    "- The sample is randomly selected and is independenet. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistic \n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "- $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion. \n",
    "- $p_{o}$ is the hypothesied population proportion.\n",
    "- $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determine the p-value and rejecting or not rejecting the hypothesis\n",
    "- Using the z-value we wind the p value if the p-value is less than $\\alpha$, we reject the hypothesis, or do not reject the null hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can also use the test statistic. Let z be a test statitic value the $|z|>1.96$ we reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level. That is, when the test statistic lies outside the 95% confidence interval, we reject the null hypothesis. If it lies within the interval, we do not reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two sample-proportion test. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### State the Hypotheses: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Null hypothesis $H_{o}: ~p_{1} =p_{2}$ ,The population proportions are equal.\n",
    "- Alternate hypothesis: Two talied $H_{1}: ~p_{1} \\neq p_{2}$\n",
    "- Alternate hypothesis: One sided $H_{1}: ~p_{1} > p_{2} ~or~ ~p_{1} < p_{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caluclate the pooled proportion \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where,\n",
    "- $x_{1},x_{2}$ are the number of successes in each example. \n",
    "- $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the sample sizes \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where,\n",
    "- $\\hat{p_{1}} = \\frac{x_{1}}{n_{1}}$ is the sample proportion from group 1.\n",
    "- $\\hat{p_{2}} = \\frac{x_{2}}{n_{2}}$ is the sample proportion from group 2.\n",
    "= $\\hat{p}$ is the pooled proportion \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision \n",
    "\n",
    "- For a two-tailed test, the critical values for a significance level $\\alpha$\n",
    "(take $\\alpha = 0.05$) correspond to a $z_{critical}$ value of $\\pm 1.96$\n",
    "- One can either compare the test statistic z to the critical value or calculate the p-value from the standard normal distribution.\n"
