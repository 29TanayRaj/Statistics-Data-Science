    "# t-test \n",
    "\n",
    "The Student's t-test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, accounting for the sample size and variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major varitions of t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. One-sample t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Independent two sample t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Paired t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "## One sample t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use?\n",
    "- For comparing the sample mean to a poulation mean that is known or is hypothesied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idea behind it?\n",
    "- The basic idea behind the on sample t-test is to standardize the difference between sample and population mean by considering the standard deviation in the data and the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{o}}{s/\\sqrt(n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$ is mean.\n",
    "- $\\mu_{o}$ is the expeected mean (population) or hypothesised mean.\n",
    "- $s$ is the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "- n is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This statistic has n-1 degress of freedom (used to calculate the critical value).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheis taken \n",
    " Null hypothesis \n",
    "- The sample mean and hypotheised mean are the same \n",
    "$$H_{0} : \\bar{x} = \\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Alternate hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sided \n",
    "- The sample mean and hypothesis mean are different\n",
    "$$H_{1} : \\bar{x} \\neq \\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One sided\n",
    "- One is greater than or lower than the other \n",
    "$$H_{1} : \\bar{x} < \\mu$$\n",
    "$$H_{1} : \\bar{x} > \\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions for student's tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independence of samples : The samples should be independelty drawn from the sample.\n",
    "2. Normalility of sample mean: The sample mean should follow a normal distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If the sample size is, $n>30$ the second assumption becomes less critical due to central limit theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Two Sided)** : Let's say a researcher wants to test if the average IQ of a certain group of people is 100, but they only have a sample of 15 individuals from that group. The sample mean IQ is 105, and the sample standard deviation is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{array}{r l}{\\bullet}&{{}{\\mathrm{Null}}\\,\\mathrm{hypothesis.}\\;H_{0}:\\mu=100}\\\\ {\\bullet}&{{}{\\mathrm{Alternative~iypothesis.}}\\;H_{1}:\\mu\\not=\\mathrm{~100}}\\end{array}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-statistic is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$t={\\frac{105-100}{\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{15}}}}={\\frac{5}{2.58}}=1.937$\n",
    "\n",
    "With 14 degrees of freedom ($n-1 = 15-1 = 14$), and a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05 $ the critical value for a two-tailed test is approximately 2.145 (from the t-distribution table).\n",
    "\n",
    "M1 : Since $1.937 < 2.145$ we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean IQ is different from 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "M2 : The p-value for the one-sample t-test with a t-statistic of 1.937 and 14 degrees of freedom is approximately 0.073. Which is greater than the signifiance level of 0.05. Therefore the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For making the decision for rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis both the critical value and p-value approch can be considred.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: t-test is good for smaller number of data points for higher number of data points z score test is recommended, also population variance should be known here. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent two sample t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-sample t-test is used to determine whether the means of two independent groups are statistically different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions \n",
    "1. Data must be normally distributed and come from independent sampling process.\n",
    "2. Variance of samples must not have much difference in values. (Equal variance assumption).\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\sqrt{s_p^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} \\right)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_{p}={\\sqrt{\\frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{X_{1}}^{2}+(n_{2}-1)s_{X_{2}}^{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are sample standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two independent samples:\n",
    "- Sample 1: Test scores of students who received online tutoring.\n",
    "- Sample 2: Test scores of students who received in-person tutoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample 1:**\n",
    "  - Sample size n₁ = 25\n",
    "  - Sample mean $\\bar{X}_1$ = 78\n",
    "  - Sample standard deviation (s₁) = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample 2:**\n",
    "  - Sample size n₂ = 30\n",
    "  - Sample mean $\\bar{X}_2$ = 85\n",
    "  - Sample standard deviation (s₂) = 12\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to test if there is a significant difference between the two group means.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Compute the Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the t-statistic for a two-sample t-test (assuming equal variances) is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\sqrt{s_p^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} \\right)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_p^2 = \\frac{(n_1 - 1) s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1) s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "is the **pooled variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Calculate the Pooled Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_p^2 = \\frac{(25 - 1) \\times 10^2 + (30 - 1) \\times 12^2}{25 + 30 - 2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_p^2 = \\frac{24 \\times 100 + 29 \\times 144}{53}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_p^2 = \\frac{2400 + 4176}{53} = \\frac{6576}{53} \\approx 124.075\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Calculate the t-Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{78 - 85}{\\sqrt{124.075 \\left( \\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{30} \\right)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{-7}{\\sqrt{124.075 \\times \\left( 0.04 + 0.0333 \\right)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{-7}{\\sqrt{124.075 \\times 0.0733}} = \\frac{-7}{\\sqrt{9.099}} \\approx \\frac{-7}{3.016}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t \\approx -2.32\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4: Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom for this test are:\n",
    "$$df = n_1 + n_2 - 2 = 25 + 30 - 2 = 53 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 5: Critical Value\n",
    "\n",
    "For a two-tailed test at a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ and 53 degrees of freedom, the critical value is approximately **2.006**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 6: Make a Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "- The calculated t-statistic is **-2.32**.\n",
    "- The critical t-value is **±2.006**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since **-2.32** is **less than -2.006**, we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data suggest that the mean test scores for students who received online tutoring are significantly different from those who received in-person tutoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paired t-tes\n",
    "A paired t-test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two related groups. It's commonly applied when comparing two sets of measurements from the same group or entity, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before-and-after measurements (e.g., weight loss before and after a diet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements under two different conditions (e.g., performance of the same group under two different treatments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Paired observations (e.g., the same group tested twice under different circumstances).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions of the paired t-test:\n",
    "Paired samples: The data sets must be related (e.g., from the same individuals or objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The differences between the pairs should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scale of measurement: The dependent variable must be measured at the interval or ratio scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further calculation process is same as one sample test. \n",
